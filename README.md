# SOLID Principles with GoLang

This repository provides examples and explanations of the SOLID principles applied in GoLang.

## SOLID Principles

1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class or module should have only one reason to change.
2. Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without affecting the correctness of the program.
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. 
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

## Examples

Each SOLID principle is explained in detail within the repository. You can find separate folders for each principle, and within each folder, you'll find code examples along with explanations of how the principle is applied.

- [SRP]: Single Responsibility Principle
- [OCP]: Open/Closed Principle
